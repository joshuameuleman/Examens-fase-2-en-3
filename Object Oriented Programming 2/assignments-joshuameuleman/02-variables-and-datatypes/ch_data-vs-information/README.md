# Data vs. information

What is the difference between data and information? Give an example.

Data is raw, unprocessed facts. they have no meaning until they are interpreted.

Information is data that has been processed and organized. it has become useful and meaningful for decision-making.

```cpp
//this is data
int age = 5;

//this is information

std::cout<<"My nephew is "<<age<<" years old. ";


```
