# Define a variable for age

How would you define a variable to store the age of a person in? Make sure to give it an appropriate name. Explain why you choose that exact data type.

```cpp
int age;
``` 

i would use the variable Integer (int) give it a name "age" why do i use this data type is because age is a whole number not a decimal number
